Basic code practice.<br>
Don't worry, I'm not so strict (yet). <br>
<br>
Use spaces, not tabs (you can configure it in the IDE) <br>
Try only to use extern declare in the top level RTOS tasks, pass it as pointers to sub functions. <br>
Never use HAL_Delay(), only osDelay(), but be carefull with timing.
